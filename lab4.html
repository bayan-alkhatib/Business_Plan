<h2>What is a business Plan:</h2>
    <p >A business plan is a written document that describes in detail how a business—usually a startup—defines its objectives and how it is to go about achieving its goals</p>
   <p>Operating without a business plan is not usually a good idea. In fact, very few companies are able to last very long without one. There are definitely more benefits to creating and sticking to a good business plan—including being able to think through ideas without putting too much money into them and, ultimately, losing in the end.
    Business plans can help perform a number of tasks for those who write and read them. They're used by investment-seeking entrepreneurs to convey their vision to potential investors. They may also be used by firms that are trying to attract key employees, prospect for new business, deal with suppliers or simply to understand how to manage their companies better. </p>
